# PHP Ticketing System

This project was written in my second month of learning PHP. After creating several mini-projects (login/registration systems, inserting form data into a database etc.), I wanted to create a project that combined these smaller elements.

As with most beginners, I searched for "PHP beginner projects" and a ticketing system made the most sense as a starting point, because at the time, my team was in need of a system to handle data requests/queries. I thought a basic system could be useful to my team.   



## Acknowledgements

This project was influenced by a basic ticketing system I found on Codeshack. I tried to put my own spin on it where possible. For example, I implemented a login and registration system, which uses the users details to only display tickets that they have submitted. I also implemented a dropdown list, so the user can choice which tickets to look at based on the status of the ticket. Open tickets are shown by default when the user logs in.
